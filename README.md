## JavaScript experiments
Some small experiments with JavaScript to better understand it. 

#### How to run locally
If you'd like to run any of these locally, run from the top level of the project `node folder/filename.js`

## Things learnt from recursion experiment
* Iterative was better than recursive for a very long string. 
* Recursive didn't work at very long string sizes.
* For small things the iterative version might be very complex to write / read and therefore recursive is better as efficiency difference would be negligible.
* For nested things of unknown depth would need to be recursive.
* Otherwise the consensus seemed to be to choose iterative.
