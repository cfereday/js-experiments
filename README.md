## JavaScript experiments




## Things learnt from experiment
iterative was better than recursive for a very long string. 
In fact recursive didn't even work at very long string sizes. For small things the iterative version might be very complex to write / read and therefore recursive is better as efficiency difference would be negligible. And Miklos pointed out again that for nested things of unknown depth would need to be recursion too. Otherwise, the consensus seemed to be to choose iterative. Correct me if I'm misguided anyone by the way :slightly_smiling_face:
